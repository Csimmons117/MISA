business world to empower ambitious students as they transition from the classroom into the industry 
as professionals.

in the form of weekly meetings  with speakers from a variety of employers that present to our students
about technical topics and career paths including Data Analytics, Systems Analysis, IT Security, IT Audit, 
Commercial IT, Tech Support, etc.

What we will teach you to help your journey on the IS/IT field:
---
* Using Github 
  - We will be using Github as a way to keep memebers of the club in the loops of events that will be happening as well as
    any updates and improvements we will make to the club to make sure everyoen has a good understanding of what we are planning.
